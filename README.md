BashScripting101
================

Writing and understanding scripts in the UNIX environment is something that I haven't learned. I realized that programming on Windows isn't really considered 'hacker' programming, that's why I'm working on this project to learn and write bash scripts.

Scripts
=======

date.sh - A simple script to print out the current date and time on a log file

selfcopy.sh - A script that copies itself to another script called 'backup'

fizzbuzz.sh - A script that solves the classic FizzBuzz problem
